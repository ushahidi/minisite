        <h2>Collection And Use Of Information</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Data Collected or Received from You</strong></p>
        <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are</p>
        <ul>
            <li>to provide and improve our Services,</li>
            <li>to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder),</li>
            <li>to provide you with updates, security alerts and support and administrative notices and</li>
            <li>to otherwise enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>. If you use our services we may collect certain information
            that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, profile photo, location and phone
            number (“<strong>PII</strong>”).</p>
        <p><u>Account Information</u>. If you create an Account to use our Services we will collect your name and
            email address. Optionally we may also collect your profile photo and, if you sign up for notifications,
            your phone number. </p>
        <p><u>Information You Provide to Us When Using the Services</u>. We will also collect any information and
            PII that you choose to submit via the Services, whether you hold an Account with us or not. For example,
            if you are an Ushahidi user, we will collect any PII that you provide when you post a report or fill out
            a survey created by a Primary Account Holder through the Ushahidi Services. Depending on the information
            you choose to submit, this information may be information that can be used to identify you, such as your
            name, photo, email address, phone number or location; or it may be information that is not considered
            PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.</p>
        <p><u>Information from TenFour Users</u>. If you are a TenFour user, as the Controller of your data, your
            employer may share your PII with us, including your name, phone number, address, emergency contact,
            location and email address, so that we can provide the TenFour Services.</p>
        <p><u>Billing Information</u>. When you purchase a paid subscription to any of our Services, we will collect
            via Chargebee and Braintree, our third-party payment processors, your credit card number, credit card
            expiration date and billing address to complete your order. The information provided to Chargebee is
            subject to the Chargebee Privacy Policy (available at<a href="https://www.chargebee.com/privacy.html">
                https://www.chargebee.com/privacy.html</a>). You should read the Chargebee Privacy Policy to learn
            about Chargebee’s information collection and usage.</p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p><u>Information Related to Use of the Services</u>. Our software or servers automatically record certain
            information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “<strong>Log
                Data</strong>”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders. Log Data may include
            information such as a user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, URL request, browser type, operating
            system, the web page that a user was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of
            our Services to which a user browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the
            links on our Services that a user clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the
            Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve and enhance our
            Services by expanding their features and functionality. We may use a person’s IP address to generate
            aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p>
        <p><u>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</u>. We collect certain information that your mobile device
            sends when you use our Services, like the manufacturer, model, operating system, and version of your
            device, as well as information about your use of our Services. We use this information in order to debug
            flaws in our software, identify device profiles we need to better serve, and identify versions of our
            software we need to support. </p>
        <p><u>Location Information</u>. When you use our Apps, we may collect and store information about your
            location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s
            GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location
            information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location
            information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device. You may also choose to send your
            location to us when you use certain of our Services, such as Ushahidi, TenFour, SMSsync or CrowdMap.</p>
        <p><u>Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</u>. Like many website owners and
            operators, we collect certain information when you visit one of our Sites or use our Services, even when
            you are not logged in. We use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect
            certain information.</p>
        <p><u>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons:</u></p>
        <p>“<strong>Cookies</strong>” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when
            you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve
            logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use
            Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve
            our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services
            and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser
            options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note,
            however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the
            Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may
            also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of
            Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</p>
        <p>“<strong>Web Beacons</strong>” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with
            a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or
            communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many
            visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which
            are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an
            e-mail).</p>
